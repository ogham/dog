Dogs _can_ look up!

**dog** is a command-line DNS client, like `dig`.
It has colourful output, understands normal command-line argument syntax, supports the DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS protocols, and can emit JSON.

## Examples

    dog example.net                          Query a domain using default settings
    dog example.net MX                       ...looking up MX records instead
    dog example.net MX @1.1.1.1              ...using a specific nameserver instead
    dog example.net MX @1.1.1.1 -T           ...using TCP rather than UDP
    dog -q example.net -t MX -n 1.1.1.1 -T   As above, but using explicit arguments

## Installation

To install dog, you can download a pre-compiled binary, or you can compile it from source. You _may_ be able to install dog using your OS’s package manager, depending on your platform.


### Packages

- For Arch Linux, install the [`dog-dns`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dog-dns/) package from the AUR.
- For Homebrew on macOS, install the [`dog`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/dog) formula.


### Downloads

Binary downloads of dog are available from [the releases section on GitHub](https://github.com/ogham/dog/releases/) for 64-bit Windows, macOS, and Linux targets. They contain the compiled executable, the manual page, and shell completions.


### Compilation

dog is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
You will need rustc version [1.45.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/07/16/Rust-1.45.0.html) or higher.
The recommended way to install Rust for development is from the [official download page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), using rustup.

To build, download the source code and run:

    $ cargo build
    $ cargo test

- The [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner can be used to run some helpful development commands, in a manner similar to `make`.
Run `just --tasks` to get an overview of what’s available.

- If you are compiling a copy for yourself, be sure to run `cargo build --release` or `just build-release` to benefit from release-mode optimisations.
Copy the resulting binary, which will be in the `target/release` directory, into a folder in your `$PATH`.
`/usr/local/bin` is usually a good choice.

- To compile and install the manual pages, you will need [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
The `just man` command will compile the Markdown into manual pages, which it will place in the `target/man` directory.
To use them, copy them into a directory that `man` will read.
`/usr/local/share/man` is usually a good choice.


### Testing

dog has an integration test suite written as [Specsheet](https://specsheet.software/) check documents.
If you have a copy installed, you can run:

    just xtests

Specsheet will test the compiled binary by making DNS requests over the network, checking that dog returns results and does not crash.
